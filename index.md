# Hello, my name is __Adam Lehman__.
## Welcome to my page!

## __About Me__
#### I grew up in Middlebury, Indiana and have lived in Colorado for the past 10 years. In 2019, I thru-hiked the Colorado Trail and shortly after I discovered the world of GIS. After spending 49 days on trail, I realized how much I love looking at maps and analyzing spatial data. When I got off trail, I began looking at GIS programs. It wasn't until the fall of 2023 that I went back to school due to several reasons, but I am excited to begin a new career. 

#### I am a big environmentalist and have a passion for protecting our planet, so I am excited to be a part of the ESIIL Stars program this summer. I can't wait to further my knowledge of geographic information systems and learn more about earth data science. I studied GIS Programming at MSU Denver where we worked with Python and I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge over the coming months.
